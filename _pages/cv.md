Education
======
* B.Sc in Computer Science and Information Technology, Tribhuvan University, 2018
* M.S. in Computer Science, University of Arkansas, 2024 (expected)
* Ph.D in Computer Science, University of Arkansas, 2026 (expected)

Work experience
======
* Fall 2021 - Present: Graduate Research Assistant
  * CausalAI Lab (University of Arkansas)
    * Led a successful project in robust hate speech detection, employing techniques such as penalizing misleading words and utilizing BERT-based approaches to develop a  strong hate speech detection model.
    * Looked at the challenges faced in existing methods, finding a different approach by studying attack models as complex causal mechanisms. Used this understanding to measure their behavior using the Minimum Description Length (MDL) framework.
    * Came up with an innovative method using masked language modeling (MLM) to assess how much effort it takes to change text. This theoretical framework suggests the potential for developing techniques to identify altered text, even in the absence of original data, based on our proposed methodology.
    * Delved into causal inference in fair machine learning, learning about different cause-and-effect ideas in machine learning to support fairness and ethical AI practices.
  * Supervisor: Dr. Lu Zhang
