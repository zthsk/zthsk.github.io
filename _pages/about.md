Welcome! I'm Kshitiz Tiwari, a driven and inquisitive PhD student specializing in Natural Language Processing (NLP) at the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville. Under the guidance of Dr. Lu Zhang in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS), I am at the intersection of technology and language.

My journey in NLP is deeply rooted in a desire to make these technologies accessible to minority languages, like my native tongue, Nepali. This goal propels my research, particularly in the areas of hate speech detection and enhancing the resilience of language-based systems against adversarial attacks. My work aims to tackle contemporary challenges and contribute to a safer, more inclusive digital world.

Additionally, I am exploring Generative AI and Large Language Models. Their potential to revolutionize communication and creativity captivates me, and I am keen on understanding their complexities and ethical dimensions.

A key aspect of my research involves applying the theory of causal inference. This approach helps me uncover the mechanisms behind NLP and AI systems, striving to create models that are robust and interpretable.

In summary, my academic path is a blend of theoretical investigation and practical application, aimed at advancing our understanding and usage of language technologies. My vision is to bridge linguistic gaps with AI, particularly for underrepresented languages, shaping a future where intelligent systems enhance communication for all. Join me in exploring the fascinating world of NLP and AI, where we merge theory with innovation to craft the future of intelligent communication.
